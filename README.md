# Cybergence
Cyergence is a company that sells avant-garde tech body modificators and enhancers. The main idea behind this company and its website is to create a futuristic and electronic tone that promotes the business's mission: to pave a path of innovation and ingenuity within the cybernetic industry, improving quality of life, ultimately contributing to the greater-good of the world. We understand that websites play an enormous role in gaining interest and traffic along with profit and revenue so we made sure to construct the most concise website we can.

This site was created by Colin Richardson, Matthew Thornton, and Vincent Zhu.

Our website consists of many things, but the most notable of which include:

- Full responsiveness across all devices.

- Fully functioning login system.

- A purchasing system that reads whether or not one signed in, and if one is signed in, they are able to link their bitcoin (further enforcing the futuristic tone).

- A high-contrast, easy-on-the-eyes color palette and font.

- Use of gifs to instill a futuristic tone

- In depth details about all the products.

- An organized column arrangement allowing one to be able to comprehend information easily.

- An admin sales page that can only be accessed by the admin login credentials: username - admin | password - admin.

- Manually edited images including:

  - Each product image resized in photoshop with 
  
  - The in-depth augmented arm background removed 
  
  - The in-depth exosuit image editted for detail.

  - A custom logo made in photoshop.

- Efficient system for the product pages of all the catalogue items.

- Mission statement, ethic guidelines, and team cards added to build credibility in the company (ethos).

Thank you for considering our website. This project was very involved, for it was a huge duty to build a fictional business and website from the ground up, but this duty was one to remember.
